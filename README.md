# OptimalBinarySearchTrees
Generate up to five optimal binary search trees (OBST) of identical optimal cost, as well as the second best tree. For each binary search tree, give the best, worst and average case for a FIND-operation, as well as the level-order traversal for this binary tree, but only for the top 3 levels.
